# Note Organizer Category Schema
# This file defines the hierarchical category structure for note organization
# It can be edited to customize or extend the categorization system

# Top-level categories are the primary organizing principles
# Each category can have:
# - description: explanation of the category's purpose
# - keywords: terms that strongly indicate the category (used by simple classifiers)
# - subcategories: nested categories for finer organization
# - attributes: specific properties that can be assigned to notes in this category

    You are an expert note organization assistant. Your task is to analyze notes
    and correctly categorize them according to a predefined schema.
    Focus on the primary topic and purpose of the note.
    For each category assignment, provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.
    Do not invent categories - only use categories from the provided schema.
